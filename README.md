# World-Economic-Indicator-Using-Excel
This project aims to identify the key drivers of sustainable growth in countries and regions using the World Economic Indicator Dataset. By analyzing economic indicators and employing advanced data analysis techniques, the goal is to provide actionable insights for achieving long-term economic prosperity.

# Problem Statement

The central challenge is: "How can a country achieve sustainable growth?" Sustainable growth refers to a nation's ability to maintain consistent, balanced economic expansion over time. It is vital for ensuring long-term economic stability, fostering resilience, and enhancing the overall well-being of the population. Unlocking sustainable growth is key to securing a prosperous future.


# Dataset

I will be leveraging the World Economic Indicator Dataset, which offers comprehensive data on GDP (Gross Domestic Product), population, and other critical factors that influence a countryâ€™s economic performance. This dataset serves as a foundation to uncover the key drivers behind GDP growth and identify strategies for fostering sustainable economic expansion.


# Solution Approach

To address the problem of identifying key factors contributing to sustainable growth, I employed a systematic data analysis approach. The steps in my solution are as follows:

* Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
I consolidated and processed the dataset, handling missing values and outliers to ensure clean data. New features, such as GDP/Capita, CO2 Emission/Capita, Energy Consumption/Capita, and Tourism Outbound/Capita, were created to enhance the dataset for deeper analysis.

* Data Exploration and Insight Generation
I conducted Bivariate Analysis to explore relationships between GDP/Capita and other key features, alongside Univariate Analysis using statistical summaries and histograms to capture distribution patterns.

* Insight Evaluation and Presentation
The final presentation was crafted, summarizing the key findings and insights in an Executive Summary supported by statistical graphs and detailed visualizations in the Annexure, providing a clear storyline to guide stakeholders toward sustainable growth strategies.
